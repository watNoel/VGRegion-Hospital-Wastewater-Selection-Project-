##  Statistical analysis of resistance rates in *E. coli* and ARG carriage rates 
To run the scripts for the statistical analysis of resistance rates in e.coli and ARG carriage rates, *ecoli_resistance_rates_models.R* and *metagenomic_arg_models.R* respectively , the following R packages are required along with an R installation ( R version 4.4.0 tested on windows x64-based laptop). Typical installation time of the packages is around 5-10 minutes. 

| Package   | Version   | Purpose                                         |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| tidyverse | 2.0.0     | Data wrangling                                  |
| glmmTMB   | 1.1.14    | Negative binomial mixed effects modelling       |
| emmeans   | 2.0.1    | Estimated marginal means and contrasts          |
| DHARMa    | 0.4.7    | Checking residuals and model fit          |

The datasets used to produce the results in the paper are provided in the /inputs folder. The time to run the scripts with these datasets on a "normal" desktop computer was under 2 minutes. 

For the script *ecoli_resistance_rates_models.R*, the input dataset is the *Merged Counts E. coli* sheet of the source data excel file in the submitted paper. The file is also present in the /inputs folder and named *merged_counts_ecoli.xlsx*:
The expected output files,, providing comprehensive statistical outputs from the modelling of *E. coli* resistance rates, are found under *outputs/ecoli_stats.xlsx*.

For the script *metagenomic_arg_models.R*, metadata for the samples are needed, and a file with the ARG counts in the different samples.
These files are found under *inputs/metadata.xlsx* and *inputs/ResFinder_DB_counts_by_group.xlsx*. 
The expected output files, providing comprehensive statistical outputs from the modelling of arg counts, are found under *outputs/metagenomics_stats.xlsx*.


For the scripts to function properly, download provided datasets and take update the paths to the different datasets in the scripts per your folder structure.
The scripts assume there is a folder called output in the directory where you run the code. If it doesn't, create such a folder or change the output destination of the created xlsx files. 

NOTE: Prior to publication, all inputs and outputs have been provided as encrypted files and a passkey provided to reviewers. For testing the scripts during review, remove the encryption in order for R to be able to load the data. Upon publication, this encryption will be removed.

## Metagenomic ARG Detection Pipeline

Below is a quick and detailed description of the metagenomics pipline used in this study:

### Hardware Description

The script `arg_counter.py` processes Illumina paired-end metagenomic sequencing reads to identify and quantify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The workflow includes read quality control, read trimming, database preparation, sequence alignment against resistance gene databases, result filtering, ARG quantification, and taxonomic profiling.

The pipeline was tested on a server running **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v7.9)** equipped with **80 Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230 CPUs (2.10 GHz)** and **754 GB of RAM**. The primary programming language is **Python 3.9.15**, and the workflow requires several Python libraries and external bioinformatics tools installed using **Conda 22.9.0**.

### Python Dependencies

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| pandas | 1.5.2 | DataFrame manipulation and processing of alignment results |
| numpy | 1.23.5 | Numerical operations and data processing |
| tqdm | 4.67.1 | Progress bars for long-running steps |

All other modules used in the script (e.g. `os`, `subprocess`, `re`, `logging`, `multiprocessing`, `gzip`, `tempfile`, `shutil`, `json`, `glob`) are part of the Python standard library.

### External Bioinformatics Tools

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| FastQC | 0.11.9 | Quality control of raw and trimmed sequencing reads |
| MultiQC | 1.14 | Aggregation of QC reports across samples |
| BBMap (bbduk) | 39.01 | Adapter removal and quality trimming |
| VSEARCH | 2.22.1 | Sequence clustering and duplicate removal |
| EMBOSS (transeq) | 6.6.0 | Translation of nucleotide sequences to protein sequences |
| DIAMOND | 0.9.14 | Fast alignment of reads against protein reference databases |
| Sylph | 0.8.1 | Metagenomic taxonomic profiling |
| Sylph-tax | 1.5.1 | Taxonomic annotation and abundance summarization |

### Example Conda Environment Installation

The required Python libraries and bioinformatics tools can be installed using **Conda**. The following example creates an environment that contains the main dependencies required to run the pipeline for steps 1-6 (excluding taxonomic analysis). Specific steps in the pipeline can be specified by binary switching (i.e. `step_1=True`, `step_2=False`).

```bash
conda create -n arg_counter \
  python=3.9.15 \
  pandas=1.5.2 \
  numpy=1.23.5 \
  tqdm=4.67.1 \
  fastqc=0.11.9 \
  multiqc=1.14 \
  bbmap=39.01 \
  vsearch=2.22.1 \
  emboss=6.6.0 \
  diamond=0.9.14 \
  -c bioconda -c conda-forge
  ```


Running **steps 1–6** prior to taxonomic profiling is strongly recommended to ensure that all required intermediate files and directories are generated.

When running the taxonomic analysis `step_7` it is necessary to create an independent conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n sylph \
  sylph=0.8.1 \
  sylph-tax=1.5.1 \
  -c bioconda -c conda-forge
  ```

### Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of several steps that can be enabled or disabled in the script:

1. **Initial quality control**  
   Raw sequencing reads are assessed using FastQC and summarized with MultiQC. This process runs less than 24 hours, depending on multiprocessing.

2. **Read trimming**  
   Adapter sequences and low-quality bases are removed using BBduk. This process runs less than 24 hours, depending on multiprocessing.

3. **Post-trimming quality control**  
   FastQC and MultiQC are run again to verify trimming performance. This process runs less than 24 hours, depending on multiprocessing.

4. **Database preparation**  
   Reference resistance gene sequences are clustered with VSEARCH, translated to protein sequences with EMBOSS Transeq, filtered for valid open reading frames, and formatted as DIAMOND databases. This process runs within one hour.

5. **ARG detection**  
   Trimmed reads are aligned against the reference ARG database using DIAMOND BLASTX. This step required approximately **132 hours** when executed using four parallel processes.

6. **ARG counting and phenotype annotation**  
   Alignment results are filtered, merged with resistance phenotype information, and summarized into counts per resistance class. This process runs within one hour.

7. **Taxonomic profiling**  
   Metagenomic composition can be estimated using Sylph and Sylph-tax with the **GTDB_r226** reference database. This process runs less than 24 hours.

### Usage

The pipeline is configured directly within the script using several variables:

- `wdir` – project working directory  
- `data_dir` – directory containing raw FASTQ files  
- `out_dir` – output directory for results  
- `db_dir` – directory containing reference databases  

The script `arg_counter.py` should be located in the working directory (`wdir`).

Ensure that within the `wdir` there exists a `data/` directory that contains `output/` where the results will be generated and the `dataDirectory/` folder that contains all the Illumina paired-end FASTQ files. Moreover, ensure that `databases/` also exists where the `ResFinder_DB/` is located that contains all the files downloadable from **ResFinder** `wget https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/resfinder_db/get/d1e607b8989260c7b6a3fbce8fa3204ecfc09022.zip`.

The pipeline expects Illumina paired-end FASTQ files (`*.fastq.gz`) with filenames following the pattern:

```bash
sampleID_L00X_R1_001.fastq.gz
sampleID_L00X_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

where `X` corresponds to sequencing lanes.

Pipeline steps can be toggled by modifying the boolean variables at the beginning of the script:

```python
#Quality check
step_1 = True
#Trim reads
step_2 = True
#Quality check after trimming
step_3 = True
#Create Databases
step_4 = False
#Create Resfinder DB
step_4_1 = False
#Run Diamond
step_5 = False
#Perform analysis on count data
step_6 = False
# Taxonomic Profiling
step_7 = False
```
Steps should be executed sequentially to ensure successful completion of the pipeline.

**Example execution**:

Activate the environment before running the pipeline that excludes taxonomic analysis (steps 1-6):

```bash
conda activate arg_counter
```

Activate the environment before running the pipeline for only taxanomic analysis `step_7`:

```bash
conda activate sylph
```
**Steps 1–6 and step 7 cannot be executed within the same session**, as they require different Conda environments.

And in the bash terminal:

```bash
python arg_counter.py
```

### Runtime
Due to the large volume of sequencing data typically processed, running this analysis on a desktop computer is not recommended. The pipeline was tested on a server running **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v7.9)** with **80 Intel® Xeon® Gold 6230 CPUs (2.10 GHz)** and **754 GB RAM**. The most time-consuming step was **DIAMOND BLASTX**, which required approximately **132 hours** when executed using four parallel processes. Overall, the entire pipeline can typically be completed in **approximately seven days**.


### Output

The pipeline produces multiple output directories containing:

* Quality control reports (FastQC, MultiQC)

* Trimmed sequencing reads

* DIAMOND alignment results

* Filtered ARG detection tables

* ARG counts summarized by resistance class

* Relative taxonomic abundance tables

The following files are produced and used for downstream analysis in R:

```
ResFinder_DB_counts_by_group.tsv
merged_taxonomy_abundance.tsv
```

## Usage

All three scripts are designed to be run in R (tested on **R 4.5.1** within the **RStudio IDE 2025.05.1, Build 513**). Typical usage steps:

1. Set the working directory in each script to where your metadata and input files are stored:
   ```r
   setwd("path/to/files")
    ```
2. Ensure the metadata CSV and taxonomy/ARG input files exist and are named correctly within the same working directory:

* Metadata: `metadata.csv` - Found as part of the supplementary files.

* ARG counts: `ResFinder_DB_counts_by_group.tsv` - Output of the metagenomics pipeline.

* Taxonomy: `merged_taxonomy_abundance.tsv` - Output of the metagenomics pipeline.

* Phenotypes mapping: `phenotypes.txt` - File from the ResFinder repository.

Optional: Adjust parameters within the scripts:

* `top_n` (`Taxonomy_Script.R`) – number of top taxa to visualize

* `tax_level` (`Taxonomy_Script.R`) – e.g., `"p__"` for phylum

* Filtering by ARG class/gene (`ARG_Counts_Script.R`)

4. Run the scripts in R or RStudio:

```R
source("ARG_Counts_Script.R")
source("Beta_Diversity_Script.R")
source("Taxonomy_Script.R")
```

### Runtime

All R scripts are lightweight and designed for downstream analysis and visualization. When executed on a standard desktop computer (tested within **R 4.5.1** in **RStudio IDE 2025.05.1**), each script typically completes within **5 minutes** depending on dataset size.

Approximate runtimes:

| Script | Typical Runtime |
|------|------|
| `ARG_Counts_Script.R` | < 5 minutes |
| `Beta_Diversity_Script.R` | < 5 minutes |
| `Taxonomy_Script.R` | < 5 minutes |

### Output
Each script generates plots and summary tables:

**ARG_Counts_Script.R**

* Stacked bar plots of top ARG classes per sample group (`Plots/arg_counts.tiff`, `Plots/arg_counts.svg`)

* Normalized data and summary tables embedded in R objects (`normalized_data`, `summary_data`)

**Beta_Diversity_Script.R**

* PCoA plots with convex hulls (`Plots/beta_div.tiff`, `Plots/beta_div.svg`)

* PERMANOVA and beta-dispersion results in R objects

* Optional pairwise PERMANOVA tables

**Taxonomy_Script.R**

* Stacked bar plots of relative abundances at the selected taxonomic level (`Plots/tax_phyla.tiff`, `Plots/tax_phyla.svg`)

* Summarized relative abundance tables per group embedded in R objects (`complete_df_summarized`)

* All figures are exported as both TIFF (high-res) and SVG (vector) formats.
